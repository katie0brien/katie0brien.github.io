Hello From the Save Your Student Crew!
</h6>
<p>
	Save Your Students was created by students, for students. Yes! We're students just like you. We know the struggle of trying to save you money, but not getting anywhere due to having to buy expensive books for school.
	Katie is getting a double-major in Web Programming and Design and Data Visualization. She likes to juggle in her free time, although she isn't quite good at it yet.
	Kmyla is getting a degree in Animation with a minor in Computer Science. You can find her working at Cozy's as well!
	Sarah is majoring in Web Programming in Design as well, with a minor in Psychology. She spends most of her time with Marlo the Cat, although we can't be sure he likes the attention all that  much.
	Halle is our odd gal out, as she's majoring in Business. She also works at Starbucks, so when you need a quick coffee, she's ya girl :)
	Siana is also majoring in Web Programming in design, and she participates in Greek Life.
	Ethan? Yeah, he didn't contribute to this project in any way. Not even in moral support and snacks.
